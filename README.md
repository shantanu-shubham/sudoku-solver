# sudoku-solver


This C++ solution can solve even 'hard' sudoku problems almost instantly. It takes
longer to input the board, then it does to solve the problem.

__How to use__

Open the project in Visual Studio and execute the file SudokuSolver.cpp .
You can provide input board in console or read from a file.
Place the file with board in the same folder as the cpp file.
Provide the filename in the console.

See SampleSudokuBoard.txt for example.
